  <p>As you just read, my name is Spencer LaPray, the guy behind SLCoding . . get it?  I have a passion for 
        problem solving and enjoy finding creative solutions to make life easier! This passion for problem solving
        led me to Web Design and Development! This line of "work" fulfills my curiosity at the deepest levels and 
        brings me a high level of joy and excitement! </p>    
  
  <p>I'm not your average "nerd", I've got a passion for sports unrivaled by . . well, almost anything. I'm an avid
        Utah Jazz and *cough* BYU *cough* fan. </p>
